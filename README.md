## Opioid treatment programs and medication dispensing clinics in Chicago 

The objective of this repository is to assess the spatial relationship between the accessibility of opioid treatment programs/opioid treatment medication clinics and opioid related deaths across Chicago’s 77 Community Areas. Additionally, this paper will look at pharmacy accessibility in relation to areas that have a high concentration of opioid related deaths. As states struggle to address the “Opioid Epidemic” there is movement to increase accessibility of opioid treatment medications such as Methadone and Buprenorphine. As of now, these medications are highly regulated, and states have strict laws about what facilities can dispense these drugs.
